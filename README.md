Your graduation ceremony is on the last day of the academic year, which is the Nth day.

Find answer for the following question

1. The number of ways to attend classes over N days.
2. The probability that you will miss your graduation ceremony.

Test cases:
for 5 days: 14/29
for 10 days: 372/773


Sample input:

N1=5
N2=10

Sample Output:

1.Number of ways to attend classes over 5 days=29
2.Probability that the student will miss the graduation ceremony 14/29


1.Number of ways to attend classes over 10 days=773
2.Probability that the student will miss the graduation ceremony 372/773
